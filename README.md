# Core by Clare Smyth â€“ Demo Website

This repository is a **mini-project** built with the [Bespoke Core Starter Kit](https://github.com/piotr-bania/bespoke_core) to demonstrate how the starter can be adapted into a real-world, fine dining restaurant website.

The project takes inspiration from **Core by Clare Smyth** (3 Michelin-starred, Notting Hill, London).  
It is not affiliated with or commissioned by the restaurant â€” it exists purely as a **portfolio showcase** to highlight design, animations, and development workflow.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

- Showcase an **awwwards-level web experience** for restaurants and hospitality.
- Demonstrate how the Bespoke Core Starter Kit accelerates builds:
  - Config-driven content (`/content/config.json`)
  - Centralised helpers (`/lib/config.js`)
  - Brand palette managed via `_tokens.scss` and `hero.mjs`
  - Reusable animated transitions (Enter/Leave clip-path system)
- Create a **convincing client-facing demo** to share in outreach (email, LinkedIn, DM).
